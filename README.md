This project demonstrates regression analysis using Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict house prices. It includes preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation with metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ². The dataset is scaled for better performance, and the models are optimized for accurate predictions.
